# Intro training path for new Interns

## Getting Started
Start working through the list below:
* Do the [Basic HTML/HTML5 course & Basis CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) on freeCodeCamp.
* Read about [Version Control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control).
* Do the [GitHub 101 training](https://services.github.com/on-demand/) online
* Do the [Command Line Intro](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) on codecademy
* Watch vids on Jekyll [Layouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQsGdCWv4I&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&index=12) & [Includes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfcJeRby2a8&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&index=14).

Some additional suggestions:  
* Keep a running list of questions so that we can be sure to cover those when we get together.
* Keep a work log or journal to track the things you do. At the end of each day or throughout your day, jot down the things you learned or worked on. This doesn't have to be extensive, just enough to keep track. This will help with your check-in meetings and also with your resume/job search/interviews later on.
* Feel free to IM/email me between sessions if you get stuck somewhere or need more things to work on. 
* Try to get coffee/lunch/hangout with someone around the office once a week, even if it's on a different team and also go to local meetups if you have the time. It's good to get out there and meet people and build your network. You'll find that most jobs/opportunities come from people you've met and not from cold job applications to a company.

Other resources to start familiarizing yourself with:
